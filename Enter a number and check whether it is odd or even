### Another method to take the inputs using for loop
range_number = input("Enter the range:")
print("Entering the for loop")

for num in range(0,int(range_number)):
    if( int(num) % 2 == 0) :
        print("The number is even" + " " + "and the number is " + str(num))
    else:
        print("The number is odd"+ " " + "and the number is " + str(num))
